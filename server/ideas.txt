Based on your plant management app, here are some background task ideas:
Data Analysis & Insights

Plant health scoring: Calculate health metrics based on care frequency, growth rate, and alert history
Care pattern analysis: Identify which plants consistently need more attention and suggest care plan adjustments
Cost tracking: Aggregate monthly/yearly spending across plants, systems, and supplies
Growth tracking: Monitor size changes over time and flag plants with unusual growth patterns

Maintenance & Cleanup

Alert cleanup: Remove resolved or expired alerts automatically
Data archival: Move old chat messages or completed todos to archive collections
Duplicate detection: Find and flag potential duplicate plants, species, or other records
Orphaned data cleanup: Remove references to deleted items (e.g., care plans with no associated plants)

Notifications & Reminders

Budget alerts: Warn when monthly spending approaches budget limits
System maintenance: Remind about cleaning sensors, replacing lights, or calibrating equipment
Inventory restocking: Alert when soil mixes are running low based on usage patterns
Goal deadline warnings: Notify about approaching goal due dates

External Integration

Weather sync: Pull local weather data to adjust care recommendations
Backup creation: Export data to cloud storage or generate recovery files
Image processing: If you add photos, resize/optimize plant images automatically
API health checks: Monitor external services your app depends on

Optimization Tasks

Database indexing: Analyze query patterns and suggest index optimizations
Cache warming: Pre-load frequently accessed data
Performance metrics: Track response times and system resource usage
Log rotation: Manage application logs and cleanup old entries

Which of these align with your app's goals? The plant-specific ones seem most relevant given your current domain focus.
